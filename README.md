# Utilities

These utilities are primarily for [Generic Character Sheet](https://github.com/Rangoric/generic-character-sheet-website).

## JWT

Wrap up functionality to deal with jwt tokens generated by Auth0. Designed to work with AWS Lambda Functions and Azure Functions.

### How To Use

```fsharp
open Utilities.Jwt

let (isValid, claimPrinciple, actorProfile) = JwtSecurity.IsValid request//(request:HttpRequest)
let (isValid, claimPrinciple, actorProfile) = JwtSecurity.IsValidInGroups request groupList//(request:HttpRequest) (groupList:string list)
```

I don't rememeber if F# and C# tuples are compatible so this might work.

```csharp
using Utilities.Jwt;

var (isValid, claimPrinciple, actorProfile) = JwtSecurity.IsValid(request);
var (isValid, claimPrinciple, actorProfile) = JwtSecurity.IsValidInGroups(request, groupList);
```

### Testing

To Be Improved. Have to change it to expose testable pieces. Or expose itself in a testable way.
